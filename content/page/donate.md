Things your donation would pay for:
- Hosting: some features require a fast and dedicated web server that 
  is rented from and secured by a trustworthy third party.
- Code signing: if you'd like to get rid of nasty OS security popups and false positives in
  your favourite (anti)-virus-application. Signing requires certificates issued every few years and can cost something from 500â‚¬ per year
- Programming: this is the art of turning caffein into lines of functioning code. It requires a huge stock of coffee beans.
