### Hi I'm Tappi.
This is the home of my freetime applications and observations around anything Sim. 
I'm a simmer since TOCA Race driver launched on PS One. Equipped with a 
Speedster steering wheel from a back-then unknown company called Fanatec
and the ingenious Namco NeoCon.
I'd drive whole tournaments with a friend in Co-Op mode in times where a split-screen was a
standard feature.

Later I produced some media and introductions of games like Blimey Games GTR-2, GT-Legends and
some predecessors of what would become Project CARS.
