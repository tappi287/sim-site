### Hi I'm Tappi.
This is the home for my free time applications and observations around anything Sim. 
I'm a simmer since Codie's TOCA World Touring Cars launched on PS One. Equipped with a 
Speedster steering wheel from a back-then unknown company called Fanatec
and the ingenious Namco NeoCon.
I'd drive whole tournaments with a friend in Co-Op mode in times when a split-screen was a
standard feature of racing games.

Later I produced some media and introduction videos for games like Blimey Games GTR-2, GT-Legends and
some predecessors of what would become Project CARS.

Nowadays I'm producing content for automotive OEM's and are lazy enough to
code instead of repeatedly work on the same boring tasks all over again.
